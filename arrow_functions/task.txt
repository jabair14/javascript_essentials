1. Create an arrow pointer function with parameters
2. Create an arrow pointer function without parameters
3. Create a regular function. 
4. Try declaring different variable types inside of all 3 functions and accessing
   them outside of the function -- this is good practice for learning about Scopes
   within arrow pointer functions
